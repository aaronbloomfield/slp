## Wednesday, November 16th
- We are at the start iteration 5
  - Leads: your TPS reports were due yesterday by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
    - Two groups didn't submit it!
  - Iteration 3 evaluations were released; you have two weeks (From Mon, 11/7) to request a re-evaluation
  - We hope to have the iteration 4 evaluations out by the end of this week or early next week
- Individual evaluations are out; we'll talk about them shortly
- With the end of iteration 4, there is another *phase change*
  - This means new leads and secretaries
  - And a phase change survey again; you've received the email prompt for that
- About course registration for next semester
- Don't forget to report your hours!
- We are going to have a (small) individual project in lieu of a final exam
  - Details to follow (next week)
- All homework grades are now posted
  - Rails and Django regrades are enabled for a two week period (until November 17th)
- You can't `sudo` on the course server, so please stop trying
- My office hours are 9:30-10:30 on Mondays and 9:30-11:30 on Wednesdays
- Today is a group work day
 - As we approach the end of the semester, there are fewer "useful" lectures for me to present
- After today, we only have 4 meetings left!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it5goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 5
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- In the first week, complete the end-of-phase survey
- Have a preliminary system that implements the minimum requirements working on the course server
  - Recall that the final system to implement the minimum requirements is due by the end of iteration 6
- Ask the customer about where the system will be deployed
  - When you get a response (even if that response is "I don't know yet"), please fill out an 'other' report
  - The intent here is to get the customer to start thinking about it; you don't need them to have any or all of the details at this point
- No more unit tests this iteration (but there will be more required next iteration)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Individual evaluations
- You can view these in the PostEm tab of the course management system
- These are not used *directly* in determining the final course grade
  - We will re-determine things at the end of the semester; that updated one will count in your final grade
  - But it provides a good idea of what we are thinking at this point
- Many of the fields are information stored elsewhere
  - Reported hours, content from the evaluations, etc.
- Other fields can't be determined until the end of the semester
- The most important fields are:
  - unexcused absences
  - iterations without any reported times
  - surveys not completed (although everybody currently has zero here)
  - mid-semester individual rating of the work you are doing
  - mid-semester individual rating comments
  - notes, resposnes, and special cases (this is all 1 field)
- Pretty much every other field is simply restating information you have seen elsewhere
- I'll pause while you all go look it up...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sample Grading Metric
- This is a reminder the [course introduction slide set](course-introduction-fall.html#/grades)
- Base metric
  - 50%: iteration evaluations
  - 30%: final project evaluation
  - 10%: homeworks
  - 10%: final exam, project, or presentation
- Modifications
  - Group work is multiplied by a *factor*, which is an estimate of how much work you did for the group
  - Penalties for missing class or not completing your reported times
  - Massive penalties for not completing the surveys
- This is all subject to change, of course...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Challenging your evaluation
- Please keep in mind that our information is imperfect!
  - The reason we do this evaluation is to give you a chance to correct any misconceptions that have occurred
  - And to make changes moving forward
- Yet you still have wrath to vent!  How to do so?
- If we got something wrong, we want you to let us know!
- Please fill out a regrade for the "Individual mid-semester evaluation, fall 2016" assignment
  - Make it clear what we missed!  And any evidence that supports your claim
- We will process these, consider each one, and (eventually) repsond to each one
- However, we are *NOT* going to be updating that PostEm entry with the results
  - You can see the response when you view your regrade
- Please submit any regrades within two weeks from today (so until November 30th)

## Goals for Iteration 4
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Everybody should complete 5 more unit tests
  - You don't need to also do a fixture, as long as you did one in the last iteration
  - This means you should have at least 10 unit tests per team member
- The wireframes should be (presumably) finalized, and likely implemented, by the end of this iteration
  - Please still keep copies in the docs/wireframes directory in your repo!
- As the iterations continue, there will be fewer specific requirements (other than "do work" and "write tests")
- Keep in mind that at the end of iteration 5, you will have to have a preliminary version of the final system running on the course server
  - Here, "the final system" means the system that impelements the minimum requirements
  - Are you keeping your reqirements document updated?

## Goals for Iteration 3
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
  - Some of this will be the work done on the wireframing, some will be the work done on the CI testing
  - Your site should have significnantly more functionality than last time
- In the first week, complete the end-of-phase survey
- Show the wireframe to the customer, get their feedback, iterate on the design
- You will have to configure your site with one of two CI servers: [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
  - The [last two slides](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/howtobegin) of the [Continuous Integration Testing](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/) slide set discuss how to begin
  - Each group was assigned to one or the other; assignments are [here](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/assignments)
  - The respective CI server is already set up to run tests on your repo on every push
  - Yout have to write the configuration file to get it to work properly
  - Extensive instructions for how to configure it (as well as sample configured projects) are available: the [CI testing slide set](../slides/09-ci-testing.html), the [CI setup](../docs/ci-setup.html) page, and two sample configured repos ([cake3-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/cake3-test) and [django-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/django-test))
    - Because nobody is using Rails, the rails-test repo was not updated this year, and is not being made available
- You will have to write a number of unit tests (at least 5 per person)
  - And one fixture each!  Note that at least one of your tests has to actually *use* that fixture.

## Moving over to virtualenv
- On pegasus, using the `virtualenv` command, create your virtual environment
  - Pick a reasonable directory name: ~/venv-django-1.10, or whatever:
```
virtualenv ~/venv-django-1.10
```
  - Add "`-p /usr/bin/python3`" right after "`virtualenv`" if you are using Python 3
- Email me the directory name so I can configure the web server
  - Not much will work until that's configured properly; I can do this quickly
- Enter the virtual environment: from the command line, enter:
```
source ~/venv-django-1.10/bin/activate
```
  - You will notice a difference in the prompt
  - You can leave the virtual environment by entering `deactivate` (or just logging out)
- Install the packages that you need via pip (or pip3, if you are using Python3):
```
pip install foo
pip install bar==1.2.3
```
  - Your installation instructions will list all the packages (and versions) that you need installed!
- Reload the web server as needed: `/usr/local/bin/reload-apache2`

  <section data-markdown id="citestingworkday"><script type="text/template">
## Today's task
- Today we will be working on the CI testing setup
- No groups are fully there yet (which is fine, since it's due at the end of the iteration)
  - 9 (of 15) groups have passing builds, but nobody has a significant number of their unit tests written yet
  - In addition, recall that each *person* must contribute at least 5 valid test cases (and one fixture per person; and at least one test must use that fixture)
- To do today:
  - Get Travis or Circle configured for your project: extensive instructions for how to configure it (as well as sample configured projects) are available: the [CI testing slide set](../slides/09-ci-testing.html), the [CI setup](../docs/ci-setup.html) page, and two sample configured repos ([cake3-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/cake3-test), [django-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/django-test), and [rails-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/rails-test))
  - Contribute the desired number of unit tests (at least 5 per person)
- At the end of today's class, all the build status badges should be green!
- A note about container usage
  - We only have one container for all 15 groups; this will cause delays if everybody pushes their commits around the same time, as they get queued up
  - If you are just doing unit tests, then please hold off on pushing those to let all the groups configure their builds (i.e., generate green status bars)
  - You should be able to run the unit tests in your development environment, so you can confirm to yourself that they works

## Monday, October 24th
- We are in the middle of iteration 3
  - Leads: your weekly reports are due tomorrow by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
  - Iteration 2 evaluations were released late last week; you have two weeks (From Mon, 10/24) to request a re-evaluation
  - With the end of iteration 2, all groups had a *phase change*: new leads and secretaries
- Phase change survey
  - See [here](#/phasechangesurvey) and [here](#/citestingsetup) for details
  - It must be completed very soon; reminders were sent last night
- Don't forget to report your hours!
- The Cake and the git/github HW grades are posted, and regrades are enabled for a week or two.
  - Rails and Django grades should be posted shortly
- You can't `sudo` on the course server, so please stop trying
- All the course materials can be found online at http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp (or /pdr for CS 2150 stuffs)
- My office hours are 9:30-10:30 on Mondays and 9:30-11:30 on Wednesdays
- Today is a group work day
  - Next Wednesday will be a continuous integration work day
  - It will help you quite a bit if you get it actually configured on Travis *before* Wednesday
    - Five groups have done so already
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 3
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
  - Some of this will be the work done on the wireframing, some will be the work done on the CI testing
  - Your site should have significnantly more functionality than last time
- In the first week, complete the end-of-phase survey
- Show the wireframe to the customer, get their feedback, iterate on the design
- You will have to configure your site with one of two CI servers: [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
  - The [last two slides](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/howtobegin) of the [Continuous Integration Testing](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/) slide set discuss how to begin
  - Each group was assigned to one or the other; assignments are [here](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/assignments)
  - The respective CI server is already set up to run tests on your repo on every push
  - Yout have to write the configuration file to get it to work properly
  - Extensive instructions for how to configure it (as well as sample configured projects) are available: the [CI testing slide set](../slides/09-ci-testing.html), the [CI setup](../docs/ci-setup.html) page, and two sample configured repos ([cake3-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/cake3-test) and [django-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/django-test))
    - Because nobody is using Rails, the rails-test repo was not updated this year, and is not being made available
- You will have to write a number of unit tests (at least 5 per person)
  - And one fixture each!  Note that at least one of your tests has to actually *use* that fixture.

## Phase change survey
- Everybody has to fill it out!
  - It's a course requirement
- The *ONLY* people in the class that will see the results are myself and the graduate TA
  - I encourage you to be open an honest, and I promise I will preserve your anonyminity
- It should take about 10 minutes to complete
- The same survey will be completed after each phase
  - So you will have to complete as many as there are members in your group
- You can see the questions asked [here][5] (it's in Collab, under Resources/surveys/phase-change); it has pages [1][1], [2][2], [3][3], and [4][4]
- There is about a week-long period to fill it out
  - There is a big grade penalty for not filling it out (or just giving quick dummy answers)
- You will receive a survey prompt shortly, as well as increasingly anxious reminders
- There is a *timeout* issue with regard to filling out surveys
  - LimeSurvey (the survey tool being used) will time you out after 10 (or so) minutes -- and then you'll have to start over!
  - So, if you want to spend time thinking about the responses, look over the survey in Collab first!
  - If you do get timed out, I can send you your previouslly completed responses

## CI Testing Setup
- Today is the lecture on [continuous integration testing](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/)
- All of you now have access to three more repos mentioned in that lecture set: [cake-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/cake-test), [rails-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/rails-test), and [django-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/django-test)
  - You will only need to use the one that corresponds to the platform you are using
  - Note that all three of these repos use a slightly older version of the frameworks, but the setup should be the same
    - Let me know if anything doesn't work!
- I will shortly be enabling TravisCI for all of your repos
  - It will email you when a build fails; I wanted to warn you about this before I flipped the switch
  - Note that if a lot of people push their commits at the same time, it will form a long queue of the ones waiting to be tested
- There is an entire page named [Continuous Integration Testing: Getting Started](../docs/ci-setup.html), and you should read that and the [CI testing slide set](../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/)

## Goals for Iteration 2
- Have a site that should start to look like a workable site for the requirements
  - Some just had one or two MVC components for the first iteration (which was fine, as that is what was required for then)
  - Going to http://server/tag should bring up something other than "Hello World", or the Django error page
  - In particular, one should be able to go to the various CRUD operations
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Your regular iteration meeting with the customer and the grad TA should happen
- Specific goals:
  - Generate wireframes: that's [an entire lecture](../slides/08-wireframing.html#/); this will likely take 3 or 5 story points of work.  The intent is to show them to the customer in iteration 3
  - Enable easy deployment via automatic logins or ssh keys: see the [Development Environment Setup page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details.  This also includes enabling easy downloading of the database
  - Publishing to the course server is best done via a github web hook and deploy key; see [that same page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details, but only I can set up both of those due to the github security setup
  - Ensure that *everybody* in the development group can develop on his/her own machine
- Some things to keep in mind:
  - Your requrements document will be iterated on throughout the year
  - What format you keep it in is up to you (although we recommend markdown), but we need to be able to view it
  - Having the source (from the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) repo) copied into a `docs/` directory in your repo is quite reasonable
	  </script></section>

          <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Slack setup
- Each team should have a slack (slack.com) setup enabled, with github integration
  - Likely, you will want to integrate github on a "development" channel
  - But only I can do this (as only I'm an admin for the uva-slp organization)
- The plan:
  - For the first half of today's class, I'll go around to each group
  - During that time, please set up slack for your group
  - In the second half of the class, I'll help you get the github integration set up
  - Note that you should still be having your workday today as well!

- The homeworks are all finished!  The Cake and the git/github HW grades are posted, and regrades are enabled for a week or two.
- You are welcome to use the VirtualBox Linux image for your development, or install it natively on your machine (more on how to do this shortly)
  - Plasmashell crash issue: the culprit seems to be tooltips, so try disabling them (right click taskbar -> Task Manager Settings -> General -> Uncheck "show tooltips")
- You can't `sudo` on the course server, so please stop trying
- All the course materials can be found online at http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp (or /pdr for CS 2150 stuffs)
- My office hours are 9:30-10:30 on Mondays and 9:30-11:30 on Wednesdays
- If you didn't sign the [legal agreement](student-participation-form.pdf) then you will have to do so today
- There will be a few (easy) additional iteration 2 requirements explained on Wednesday (set up slack, etc.)
- Schedule: today is a group work day
  - Wednesday will be the [wireframes](../slides/08-wireframing.html#/) lecture, and a few wireframes will need to be done for this iteration
  - The following few weeks we will see: continuous integration testing and documentation

## Goals for Iteration 2
- Have a site that should start to look like a workable site for the requirements
  - Some just had one or two MVC components for the first iteration (which was fine, as that is what was required for then)
  - Going to http://server/tag should bring up something other than "Hello World", or the Django error page
  - In particular, one should be able to go to the various CRUD operations
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Your regular iteration meeting with the customer and the grad TA should happen
- Specific goals:
  - Generate wireframes: that's [an entire lecture](../slides/08-wireframing.html#/); this will likely take 3 or 5 story points of work.  The intent is to show them to the customer in iteration 3
  - Enable easy deployment via automatic logins or ssh keys: see the [Development Environment Setup page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details.  This also includes enabling easy downloading of the database
  - Publishing to the course server is best done via a github web hook and deploy key; see [that same page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details, but only I can set up both of those due to the github security setup
  - Ensure that *everybody* in the development group can develop on his/her own machine
- Some things to keep in mind:
  - Your requrements document will be iterated on throughout the year
  - What format you keep it in is up to you (although we recommend markdown), but we need to be able to view it
  - Having the source (from the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) repo) copied into a `docs/` directory in your repo is quite reasonable
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Iteration 1 evaluations
- They were released last night (or early this morning)
- It turns out that most people just ignored the iteration 1 goals...
  - 15 people did not have a git commit
  - 10 people did not submit any hours
  - Most groups did not have a working CRUD website
- Of the 15 group evaluations, 10 were poor, 2 were fair, and 3 were good
  - This directly affects your entire group's grade!
- If you feel we did not judge you fairly, then you may request a re-evaluation within 2 weeks
  - Basically, speak to the graduate TA at your next meeting with him
  - Note that we will *only* judge you based on the work you completed at the end of the iteration; if you completed something afterward, then it doesn't count for the just-ended iteration

- We are half-way through iteration 1
- The homeworks are all finished!  Yay!  We are working on grading them...
- You are welcome to use the VirtualBox Linux image for your development, or install it natively on your machine (more on how to do this shortly)
  - Plasmashell crash issue: the culprit seems to be tooltips, so try disabling them (right click taskbar -> Task Manager Settings -> General -> Uncheck "show tooltips")
- Leads: your weekly report was due yesterday by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
  - Everybody got it in!
  - You submit it via the [course administration system](https://slp.cs.virginia.edu:444/admin/)
  - Your TPS report will be due next Tuesday at noon, and we won't have class the day before for me to remind you...
- You can't `sudo` on the course server, so please stop trying
- My office hours are 9:30-10:30 on Mondays and 9:30-11:30 on Wednesdays
  - But I won't hold mine this Wednesday or next Wednesday unless you mention to me that you'll be there...	
- CS town hall with the CS dept chair!  Did anybody go?  How did it go?
- If you didn't sign the [legal agreement](student-participation-form.pdf) then you will have to do so today
- Schedule
  - Today we will see [project estimation](../slides/07-estimation.html), and start the estimating

## Goals for iteration 1
See [here](../slides/05-project-start.html#/it1goals) for full details, but briefly:

- Fully understand the requirements
- Meet with the customer
- Design (and implement) a basic DB schema
- Get your dev environment set up (see [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) for guidance)
- Get a basic MVC site working on the course server
  - Once done, this will require you emailing me so that I can complete the apache2 configuration
- Have the system stored properly in the github repo (no passwords!!!)
  - That means having all your framework created files in an app/ folder!
- Enter all the requirements as tasks as Github issues as described [here](../slides/07-estimation.html#/task)
- Everybody MUST have a github commit this iteration (and, in general, every iteration)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Getting the site running on the course server
- This is one of the requirements for iteration 1
- You will need to configure it on your end
  - Basically, follow the asme instructions as with the appropriate framework homework
  - For Django, this includes running wsgi-admin
- Then email me, so I can complete the installation
  - There are tweaks and such
  - The URL will then be http://server/tag (for django and rails) or http://server/~tag (for cake)
- Then adjust the system as necessary
- This means it requires some work on my end to get it fully functional
- I am NOT going to be staying up late next Monday, during my fall vacation, to do this for you
  - So don't wait until the last minute...

## Project notes and erratta
- Meeting reservation updates:
  - Normally, undergrads are *not* allowed to make room reservations in Rice as there are not enough conference rooms for even the faculty who want to meet
  - However, an exception has been (and will be) made for SLP students
  - Pursuant to this, *please* follow these two rules:
    - Please only make meetings for when you are meeting with the customer or grad TA (although Jordan will make the latter ones for you)
    - Please only make meetings for the times you need, and use it for those times!
  - I am very sorry that there are not more rooms for you all to meet separately
    - That being said, if you squat in a room, the worst that will happen is that somebody will ask you to leave...
- Communication tools: there are a bunch available
  - You can create a email list at https://lists.virginia.edu
  - You can (and should!) create a [slack account](https://slack.com)
  - And others...
- Note that the intent is for *all* of the group to be present at the customer (and graduate TA) meetings
- We have now entered our "tyipcal" schedule: group meetings (in class) on Mondays, lecture or in-class workday on Wednesdays, and no class on Fridays
- If you are interested, the entire list of iteration goals is in the [iteration goals slide set](iteration-goals.html#/)
  - Keep in mind that there may be a few tweaks to future goals, but I don't expect much to change
  - I will cut-and-paste the relevant goals from that into the daily announcements, so you don't have to check that file if you don't want to

  - You are more than welcome to change the password, if you would like
  - Or you can set up [auto-login](../docs/dev-env-setup.html)
- The github repos are all ready, and issues and the wiki have been enabled on each
  - I did an initial commit for each
- You have access to the [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) repo

## Project Descriptions
- They are in a github repo: https://github.com/uva-slp/projects
  - You were all invited to join the uva-slp organization last Friday
  - Note that you have to *accept* the invitation to view the repo!
  - If you lost that invitation email, go to https://github.com/uva-slp, and follow the prompts
  - You are welcome to read the past project descriptions, but the 2016 projects are what we care about
  - They are in Markdown, HTML, and PDF; you can easily view them on github via: https://github.com/uva-slp/projects/blob/master/2016/readme.md
- A few projects have *required* platforms:
  - Python/Django: Loaves & Fishes, UVa Info Sec
  - Ruby on Rails: Innisfree
  - Unknown: McIntire Botanical Garden (should know that in a day or two)
- Two projects are *REQUIRED* to be open source:
  - Programming Contests @ UVa and Meals on Wheels
- Everybody has to LOOK OVER each and every project!

## Year Start Survey
- Everybody must complete this survey by the "end of the day" on Friday
  - If you don't, you won't get assigned to a project, and then you cannot complete this course
  - <font color='red'>JUST TO BE CLEAR: if you do not complete this survey, you will be dropped from the course!</font>
  - I will send you periodic reminders about this, so no need to panic and fill it out today, necessarily
  - It's due by the "end of the day" on Friday (which really means about 9 a.m. on Saturday morning)
- The survey prompt emails ran into "issues", so the URL for your participation is in Collab's PostEm tool
  - That URL is tagged to your userid, so we know who you are...
- The survey system has an annoying *timeout* "feature"
  - If it is idle for too long, any responses on that page that you have not submitted are lost
  - This really only happens when people keep it open, leave for lunch (or whatever), and then come back
  - It's a really stupid design, I know...
- The survey questions are on Collab in Resources/surveys/year-start, and you can veiw it from there
  - There are four pages: [1](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p1.html), [2](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p2.html), [3](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p3.html), and [4](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p4.html)
  - So if you want to ponder your responses, you can view it there first
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Optimizing the Survey Responses
- If your responses are too constrained, I won't be able to even come close to fulfilling them
- Requesting special situations
  - If you have an *entire* group that you want to work with, you have to:
    - Have *each* potential group member list all of you to work with (both in BFFs and the end comments)
    - List similar choices for projects, platforms, etc.
    - Be *very* flexible in which group (such as stating that you will work on any of them)
  - Mortal Enemies can also be people you like, but don't want to work with (I had an engaged pair list each other as mortal enemies once)
  - BFF's are *really* hard to manage, given the other constraints -- so feel free to fill it out, but don't count on it happening
    - If your BFF lists you as his/her BFF, then it has a slightly higher chance of happening
- If you state that you are not willing to work on an open source project, then you definitely will *not* be assigned to those two groups
- If you do have any connection to a given project (or framework), please not that in the comments as well

## Monday, September 12th
- The [frameworks HW](../docs/hw-frameworks.html) is finishing up today; see [here](#/frameworkshw) for details
  - It's *much* better to get it in late than to not get it in at all (say, within a few days after it's due)
- We have a VirtualBox Linux image all configured for you
  - Plasmashell crash issue: one possibility: tooltips, so try disabling them (right click taskbar -> Task Manager Settings -> General -> Uncheck "show tooltips")
  - This solved it on at least one student's machine!
- Project status: 16 docs written!
  - Although at least 1 will not be happening this year
  - We are going to go over them today
- You can't `sudo` on the course server, so please stop trying
- It is unclear if we will have class or not this Friday (Sep 16); I'll know more about that on Wednesday
- My office hours are 9:30-10:30 on Mondays and 9:30-11:30 on Wednesdays
- Today we will be will be talking about the projects and the survey
  - In any remaining time, we will be working through [requirements](../slides/04-requirements.html#/) (starting at slide [3.8](../slides/04-requirements.html#/2/7))

## Homework status
- The [git/github HW due](../docs/hw-git.html) was due last Wednesday
- The [frameworks HW](../docs/hw-frameworks.html) has three parts; the URLs **MUST** match what is listed below:
  - CakePHP, due Mon, 9/5 (end of the day): URL: http://server/~mst3k/cakephp/
    - As long as you put your code in `~/html/cakephp`, it will have that URL
  - Rails, due Fri, 9/9 (end of the day): URL: http://server/rails/mst3k
    - That URL is already configured, as long as your Rails project is in `~/railshw/`
  - Django, due Mon, 9/12 (end of the day): URL: http://server/django/mstek
    - You set this up via the `wsgi-admin` call; we recommend putting it in `~/djangohw/`
- The course server is all configured and ready to go
  - You can find your account info in the Collab Post'Em tool
  - SSH keys: 
    - RSA key fingerprint is 51:c6:7e:a6:44:b3:8e:f9:85:57:e0:7f:fb:c7:20:d3
    - ECDSA key fingerprint is ed:1c:0e:61:94:2c:3f:53:d1:f1:dd:90:9b:f7:cb:a7
  - In theory, you should not require `sudo` to complete anything
- You have three databases that you can use (all use the same password): `mst3k`, `test_mst3k`, and `mst3k_test`
  - Use them however you would like to make the three projects work
  - If you need a fourth to make it work, let me know
- There are a few custom commands on the course server that you can use:
  - `reload-apache2`: reloads the web server
  - `view-apache2-log`: views the apache2 log
  - `wsgi-admin`: to register your Django application
- Each framework has a "getting started" page that is also updated

## Wednesday, August 31st
- The [first homework, on git and github](../../docs/hw-git.html), is out; it's due by the end of the day today (Wed, Aug 31)
  - There is also a brief [intro to git](../../docs/git-intro.html) as well, and everybody should at least skim through it...
  - You have to allow `aaronbloomfield` and `cjmincey` to be Collaborators on any private repos you create for this assignment, but *after* you complete the homework!
- The [frameworks HW](../docs/hw-frameworks.html) is also ready; more on this on the next slide
- We have a VirtualBox Linux image all configured for you
  - The image is on Collab's Resources; also see the [installation
  - Make sure you specify that it's a 64-bit guest!
  - Also see the [installation instructions](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/01-intro-unix/virtual-box.html) (from CS 2150's lab 1) and the [image details](../docs/virtualbox-image-details.html)
- Project status: 7 docs written, 1 pending, 4 meetings planned
  - Aiming to get 3 more (for a total of 15) by late next week
- Unlike CS 2150, I don't care what system you develop on
  - But most (if not all) of the software will be on a LAMP system, so you'll have to use something similar to LAMP.  I've seen people set up Mac OS X to run MAMP, and Windows to run WAMP...
- Please fill out the github userid survey at http://goo.gl/Vjn3Yx by the end of the day today
  - You should have received an email about that
  - I will need that information to get your assignments graded, and to release the project information to you
- Today we will be finishing [legal issues](../slides/01-legal.html) and starting [development methodologies](../slides/02-development-methods.html#/)

## Homework status
- The [git/github HW due](../docs/hw-git.html) is due today (by the end of the day)
- The [frameworks HW](../docs/hw-frameworks.html) has three parts; the URLs **MUST** match what is listed below:
  - CakePHP, due Mon, 9/5; URL: http://server/~mst3k/cakephp/
    - As long as you put your code in `~/html/cakephp`, it will have that URL
  - Rails, due Fri, 9/9: URL: http://server/rails/mst3k
    - That URL is already configured, as long as your Rails project is in `~/railshw/`
  - Django, due Mon, 9/12: URL: http://server/django/mstek
    - You set this up via the `wsgi-admin` call; we recommend putting it in `~/djangohw/`
- The course server is all configured and ready to go
  - You can find your account info in the Collab Post'Em tool
  - SSH keys: 
    - RSA key fingerprint is 51:c6:7e:a6:44:b3:8e:f9:85:57:e0:7f:fb:c7:20:d3
    - ECDSA key fingerprint is ed:1c:0e:61:94:2c:3f:53:d1:f1:dd:90:9b:f7:cb:a7
  - In theory, you should not require `sudo` to complete anything
- You have three databases that you can use (all use the same password): `mst3k`, `test_mst3k`, and `mst3k_test`
  - Use them however you would like to make the three projects work
  - If you need a fourth to make it work, let me know
- There are a few custom commands on the course server that you can use:
  - `reload-apache2`: reloads the web server
  - `view-apache2-log`: views the apache2 log
  - `wsgi-admin`: to register your Django application
- Each framework has a "getting started" page that is also updated
