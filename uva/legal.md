SLP: UVa Legal Forms
====================

[Go up to the main UVa page](index.html) ([md](index.md))

Unless otherwise noted, the forms on this page have been approved by the powers-that-be at the University of Virginia ("UVa") for use by UVa students participating in the Service Learning Practicum.  In particular, they are not generic legal forms for other fourth-year capstone courses at UVa!  Other institutions are welcome to look over these, but they are obviously need to be approved by that institution for use there.

**Students**, in order to participate, will need to sign the first form ("Student Participation and Release Form"), and possibly the second form ("Capstone NDA") if the nonprofit requests it. Note that there is no requirement for UVa students to sign any of these forms; however, there may be restrictions as to what projects a student can work on if s/he is not willing to sign these forms.  In particular, those restrictions will likely mean taking the independent project track to complete the capstone requirement.  For more details about not signing the forms, see [here](../slides/fall/01-intro.html#/mustisign).

**Nonprofits** only have to sign the third form ("Customer Information Agreement").  If the nonprofit wants to have an NDA in effect, then the second form ("Capstone NDA") has already been approved for use by students in this capstone course.  Any other NDA form will need to be pre-approved by UVa prior to use.  The first form ("Student Participation and Release Form") contains the licensing agreement (item 6 of the form), but that form is only signed by the students.

These forms can be printed out and completed by hand, or one can type form fields into the Word document format (all except the signatures, which must be completed by hand), and print that version.


### Student Participation and Release Form

- [Student Participation and Release Form in Word format](student-participation-form.docx)
- [Student Participation and Release Form in PDF format](student-participation-form.pdf)

This form is how a student indicates his/her awareness of what is going on in the capstone -- specifically, that software is being developed for an external entity.  Item 6 is where the license is provided to the nonprofit to use the software.  Should the student be under 18 (not likely for a fourth-year course), then the student's parent will also have to sign the form.

A few notes when filling out this form:

- In the title of the form, you have to fill in a short title for the capstone project, such as "ACME volunteer scheduler"
- The "Collaborator" is the nonprofit for which the students are developing the project.
- The school (SEAS) has already been filled in.  Even if the student is not in SEAS (CLAS majors, for example), the class itself is still a CS class, and CS is in SEAS, so the agreement is still considered to be between SEAS and the other entities (the external entity and the students).
- The "Capstone Project" line is a slightly longer description of the project -- the idea is to give a one sentence overview of what the project is or does.
- "Exhibit A", mentioned in item 7, is the Capstone NDA, above.


### Capstone NDA

- [Capstone NDA in Word format](capstone-nda-for-students.docx)
- [Capstone NDA in PDF format](capstone-nda-for-students.pdf)

This form is a generic non-disclosure agreement (NDA) between the students and the nonprofit for which the students are developing the system.  Note that this NDA only covers the data and information that the nonprofit provides to the students.  Coverage of other topics (intellectual property, technology transfer, etc.) are handled by the Student Participation Form, below.

A few notes when filling out this form:

- In the title of the form, you have to fill in a short title for the capstone project, such as "ACME volunteer scheduler"
- The "Collaborator" is the nonprofit for which the students are developing the project.
- The "Capstone Project" line is a slightly longer description of the project -- the idea is to give a one sentence overview of what the project is or does.


### Customer Information Agreement

This document ensures that the nonprofit is aware of the various disclaimers associated with this type of project (no warranty, financial responsibility, etc.), as well as various other pieces of information.  This form is not a legally binding form, and thus it was not necessary to be approved by UVa.  However, it will need to be signed by each nonprofit.
