# Introduction
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why require frameworks in this course?
- To prevent re-inventing the wheel
- Frameworks have a significant learning curve, but once learned they do most of the work for you
- This allows you to focus on *what* your web app does, and not focus so much on the low-level code
- You don't need to re-implement a linked list, so why re-implement all of the basic web app low-level stuff?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## But I want \[framekwork of choice\]!
- All of these systems have to run on a UVa server for the first part of the course
- It is not feasible to have each group pick a different framework, and then expect a reasonable hosting solution
- It makes this course much more sane if we are all on the same page…
- The chosen frameowrks represent a wide selection of what's out there
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why some frameworks weren't chosen
- C#, .NET, and ASP.NET: it requires Windows servers, which costs money (even for education) and I don't use Windows, so I don't have the requisite knowledge to configure them
- node.js: whie this is the "hot" thing, it's really focused on real-time applications that require a lot of throughput, asynchronous I/O, etc., none of which apply to our projects
- AngularJS: the focus is on single-page web applications, which is not really what we are doing in this course
- CodeIgniter, Symfony, and any other PHP framework: we already chose a PHP framework, no need to have multiple ones
- Spring: it's Java, and getting a Java app working on a web server is just an exercise in frustration
- And those are the top web frameworks by popularity...

## Model-View-Controller

<img style="background-color:white" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/MVC-Process.svg" alt="MVC image" title="&quot;MVC-Process&quot; by RegisFrey - Own work. Licensed under Public domain via Wikimedia Commons - http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MVC-Process.svg#mediaviewer/File:MVC-Process.svg">
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Model
- Represents "knowledge"
  - The fields of the table, as well as their types
  - Any validation necessary (this field is required, that field must be a number in this range, etc.)
  - Relationships to other "things"
    - A user has many posts
    - A post has only one user
- A model is the "application and business rules"
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## View
- What the user sees
- In charge of formatting information for the user
  - Formatting for a PC-based HTML page is different than a smartphone-based HTML page
  - Displaying for an app will be even more different
  - Some things may not be visible to all users (a user’s real name may only be visible to that user and the administrators)
- Gets the information to view from the model
- May also update the model (last webpage access, for example), but that is done *through* the controller
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Controller
- Represents "action"
- These are the commands / functions / etc. that a user can perform
- Perhaps through a form posting or a link
- A controller receives input, does some action, and displays the result through some view
- Those "actions" correspond to methods called on the specified controller class
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Naming controllers and actions
- ALWAYS name the controllers and actions based on what they do, not based on the URL that you want them to have
- If you want specific URLs to go to specific places, you do this via *routes*
- Don’t try to name controllers and actions based on the URL that you want; it will only cause headaches later
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="mysql"><script type="text/template">
# MySQL
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## MySQL tables
- One of the first things you will be doing on your project is to create the database schema
  - While it can certainly be modified later, creating a "more correct" one early on will save you a headache
- There are more than enough advice via a Google search
- What is listed here is a just a few to keep in mind, and ones that I came up with...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Rule 1: Pick good table names
- Table names should be general enough to allow for easy use...
  - Don’t bother with separate "teachers" and "students" tables unless you have to; have a "people" or "users" with a "isTeacher" flag
- ... but specific enough to make sense from the table name
  - "entities", "things" – what do these tables hold?
- Some table names are reserved, so be careful of those
	  </script></section>
<!--   - In Cake: emails, pages, scaffolds, layouts, errors, helpers, elements -->

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Rule 2: Don’t mix concepts
- On one project in a previous year, they needed to keep track of individuals and organizations, and they keep track of them in the same Excel spreadsheet
  - But an individual is not an organization
  - So they should be in separate tables
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Rule 3: Recognize relationships
- Make sure you understand how a given table relates to anther table
  - This means you will have to understand the various relationships:
    - hasOne (one-to-one)
    - hasMany (one-to-many)
    - belongsTo (one-to-one or many-to-one)
    - HABTM (many-to-many)
  - They will be called different things in different frameworks
- And you will need to deal with foreign keys in the DB
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Rule 4: Create the tables properly
- With Cake, you need to have `id`, `modified`, and `created` fields
- For Rails, those fields are `id`, `created_on`, `updated_on`
- For Django, it is just `id`
- All tables need to be of the innodb type
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Rule 5: Let SQL handle cascading
- If a user has a bunch of posts, and you delete the user, what happens to the posts?
  - Perhaps the user cannot be deleted until the posts are gone
  - Perhaps all the posts are deleted
  - Perhaps all the posts have their user_id set to null
- You can set this in MySQL through the "on update" or "on delete" command options
  - ... on delete cascade
  - ... on update restrict
  - ... on delete set null
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Rule 6: Let MySQL handle the types
- If you properly choose the types when creating the schema (either in MySQL or through the framework), then life will be much easier
  - Data is validated upon entry
  - The frameworks will notice the type and allow you to perform additional validation
- Pick the correct type
  - For something like a UVa userid (which is at most 6 characters), use varchar(6) rather than text
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Rule 7: Learn the framework queries
- The frameworks can perform advanced queries without needing any MySQL syntax
  - But it takes some time to learn...
- For any non-trivial data extraction, you will need to learn this...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="cake"><script type="text/template">
# CakePHP
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why CakePHP?
- There are MANY PHP frameworks out there
  - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP_frameworks) lists 26
  - And that page doesn’t list many of them!
- We did an evaluation of CakePHP versus a few others (Tonic and Recess), and everybody felt it was “better”
- It “gets out of your way”, has a reasonable learning curve, and requires minimal configuration
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Setting up CakePHP
- Choose a directory, such as `~/html/cakephp/`; the URL will then be `http://server/~user/cakephp/`
- Download the CakePHP distribution .zip file (version 3.0.0-beta1 is [here](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/releases/download/3.0.0-beta1/cakephp-3-0-0-beta1.zip), and unzip it *in* that directory
- Change two .htaccess files: in `~/html/cakephp/` and `~/html/cakephp/webroot/`: add the line `RewriteBase /~user/cakephp` *before* the close `</IfModule>`
- Edit your database info in config/app.php
- It should work, and show all green bars!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## A successful CakePHP installation
![cakephp image](../docs/images/cakephp-initial.png)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Creating things
- With CakePHP, you first create the table in the database, then create the MVC components around that
- Some things to remember:
  - Always have an `id int unsigned auto_increment primary key` as your first field
  - Always include a `created datetime default null` and `modified datetime default null` as fields as well
- Note that keywords in MySQL are case-insensitive, but user-defined identifiers are not!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Relationships
- Foreign keys in a DB are used for hasOne (one-to-one), hasMany (one-to-many), and belongsTo (one-to-one or many-to-one) relationships
  - If this_table has a foreign key of another_table, then this_table either hasOne or belongsTo another_table (you can choose)
  - Likewise, another_table either hasMany or belongsTo this_table (again, your choice)
- Separate tables are needed for HABTM (many-to-many) relationships
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Plurality and Inflection
- Models are alwasy singular case ("Post.php", "Report.php")
- Controllers are always plural case ("PostsController.php", "ReportsController.php")
- Unrelated: views always end in ".ctp" for "Cake TemPlate"
- CakePHP has an *inflector*, which can singularize or pluraize nouns as necessary
  - Common non-standard nouns work as well: Person -> People
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="rails"><script type="text/template">
# Ruby on Rails
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why Ruby on Rails?
- It's a very popular framework
  - Many popular sites are built on Ruby, including github
- The very large amount of libraries (gems), which are relatively easy to install and use, make it very easy to add a lot of functionatlity very easily
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Setting up Ruby on Rails
- Everything needed is installed on the VirtualBox image
- The following command will create the directory structure needed:
```
rails new myapp -d mysql
```
- Edit `config/database.yml`, and enter your MySQL information (up to 3 times for each field!)
- On VirtualBox, you can run `rails server`, and then view the web page via `http://localhost:3000`
- On the course server, you have to follow the instructions on the [Ruby on Rails: Getting Started page](../docs/rubyrails-getting-started.html) ([md](../docs/rubyrails-getting-started.md))
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## A successful Ruby on Rails installation
![ruby on rails image](../docs/images/rails-initial.png)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Creating things
- With Rails, you tell the framework that you want to create a table/model:
```
bin/rails generate model Article title:string text:text
```
- You then *migrate* your changes to the DB, which is what creates (or modifies) the tables:
```
bin/rake db:migrate
```
The [ActiveRecord::Timestamp](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Timestamp.html) API allows for `created_on` and `updated_on` fields
  - ActiveRecord is the gem, Timestamp is the functionaliy
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Relationships
- The ActiveRecord gem, in the [Association API](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html) manages relationships, similar to what CakePHP has
  - has_one
  - has_many
  - belongs_to
  - has_and_belongs_to_many
- It also defines *through* modifiers to has_many and has_one, indicating a 3rd model is between
  - A person has_many grandparents *through* their parents
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Plurality and Inflection
- Models use a singular name ("post")
- Database tables use a plural name ("posts")
	  </script></section>

# Python Django
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why Django?
- Python is a very nice language to program in
- It's a very popular frameowrk
- I wanted to add a 3rd framework choice this year
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Setting up Django
- Everything needed is installed on the VirtualBox image
- The following command will create the directory structure needed:
```
django-admin startproject mysite
```
  Note that this is `django-admin`, *not* `django-admin.py`
- Edit `mysite/mysite/settings.py`, and enter your MySQL information (and change the time zone)
- To set up the DB tables, run:
```
python manage.py syncdb
```
- On VirtualBox, you can run `python manage.py runserver`, and then view the web page via the URL printed
- On the course server, you have to follow the instructions on the [Django: Getting Started page](../docs/django-getting-started.html) ([md](../docs/django-getting-started.md))
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Configuring Django on the server
- You must use the `wsgi-admin` utility, as described in the [Django: Getting Started page](../docs/django-getting-started.html) ([md](../docs/django-getting-started.md))
```
wsgi-admin -register <wsgi_file>
```
```
wsgi-admin -list
```
```
wsgi-admin -remove <id>
```
```
wsgi-admin -regerate
```

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Projects versus Apps
- So far, what has been created is a *project*
  - You will also need to create one or more *apps*

&nbsp;

> What’s the difference between a project and an app? An app is a Web application that does something – e.g., a Weblog system, a database of public records or a simple poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular Web site. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Creating things
- The structure for a model is created in a Python file (`polls/models.py`, for example)
  - It's a specific Python syntax for a class
- You can then print the SQL to create the matching tables for that model:
```
python manage.py sql polls
```
- You can then have those tables automatically created:
```
python manage.py syncdb
```
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Relationships
- Django has similar relationships as the others
- For each, there is a particular keyword used in the field declaration
  - One-to-one: use `OneToOneField`
  - Many-to-one: use `ForeignKey`
  - Many-to-many: use `ManyToManyField`
- Note that belongs-to is implicit, and thus not explicitly defined
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Plurality and Inflection
- Django does not require singular and plurality like the other frameworks do
- But if you don't follow the convention, you have to separately define what the singular name and plural name are for each field!

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Survey Framework Questions
- Last year, there were two frameworks allowed: CakePHP and Ruby
  - Django was the new framework this year
- In the end-of-year survey, students were asked two framework questions:
  - What is your overall opinion of the framework you used (CakePHP or Rails)?
  - Overall, how satisfied were you with the framework that you chose to work with?
- Answers were on a 1-5 scale (1 = very unsatisifed, 3 = neutral, 5 = very satisfied)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Survey Framework Results

This is from the 2013-2014 academic year, which means these results were completed in May, 2014

|    | CakePHP | Ruby on Rails |
|--|--|--|
| Framework opinion | 4.49 | 4.01 |
| Framework satisfaction | 4.40 | 3.86 |
| Number of surveys | 13 | 26 |
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Upcoming survey questions
- For each framework, you will rate your interest from 1-5:
  1. I really DESPISE this framework, and would be very unhappy using it
  2. I would rather not use this framework, and would not be thrilled using it
  3. I am neutral about using this framework
  4. I would like to use this framework, and would be happy using it
  5. I am a FANATIC about this framework, and would be ecstatic using it
- (phrasing may vary)
- If you enter 3's for the three framework prompts, I'll assume you don't care about which framework you use
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What *not* to base your framework preference on
- The learning curve: they all have learning curves, so that's a wash
- What is the *hot* framework of the day: some Rails groups got burned last year because of this
- What your friend told you you should use
- How hard it is to configure
  - I'm doing that on pegasus for you, and it's only a one-time thing, anyway
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What you should base your framework preference on
- A desire to learn a particular language or framework
- Existing knowledge or experience using a particular framework
- Your experiences with the frameworks homework
  - But take them with a grain of salt -- it's not like none of the frameworks will cause you frustration ever
