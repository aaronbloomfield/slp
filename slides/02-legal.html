## Where does copyright come from?
- Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution, known as the Copyright Clause, empowers the United States Congress:
> To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## If I buy software, it’s mine, right?
- The software publisher grants the use of one or more copies of the software
- But the ownership remains with the software company
- Thus, in order to use it, you have to agree to the terms, typically expressed in an End User License Agreement (EULA)
  - These terms prevent things like reverse engineering, etc.
  - And, lately, to prevent class action lawsuits ([Paypal did this](http://yro.slashdot.org/story/12/10/18/1637216/paypal-slips-no-class-action-clause-into-policy-update) on Oct 18, 2012)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Reverse engineering
- If a piece of hardware is legally obtained, then reverse engineering is lawful
- But not for software, as EULAs generally forbid it
  - And federal courts have [found that EULAs override copyright law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowers_v._Baystate_Technologies)
- However, the DMCA allows for reverse engineering of software if and only if:
  - You have legally obtained it
  - It is specifically to achieve interoperability between computer programs
- This doesn't prevent you from being sued, though (anybody can file a lawsuit for anything); it just means the suit is not likely to be successful

- Launched the GNU project in<br>1983 to create a free Unix-like<br>operating system
  - Can you name the kernel?
- Pioneered the [GPL (the GNU<br>copyleft)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)
- He wrote (or heavily <br>contributed to): emacs, gcc,<br>gdb, etc.

Via Wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Heckert_GNU_white.svg#mediaviewer/File:Heckert_GNU_white.svg"></a>

- Also called the free software<br>movement
- A free software mass<br>collaboration project started in<br>January 1984
- The tools that make Linux<br>possible are GNU tools
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Free Software Foundation
- Created by Stallman on Oct 4, 1985 to support and promote the free software movement
- Employees and volunteers mostly work on legal and structural issues regarding free software

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## "Free software" became a bad term...
- Stallman’s unyielding stance and personality turned some people off to using the GPL
- And the GPL is very restrictive (see later), which also prevented some companies from releasing their code under it
- So that led to...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## "Open Source"
- Term created in 1998 by a group of leading free software individuals in reaction to Netscape’s January 1998 announcement of a [source code release](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape#Open_sourcing) to Netscape
- There are two broad categories:
  - "Free open-source software": all parts of the software are free
  - "Commercial open-source software": some parts are open source, but key parts are kept closed; used by companies who want to claim "open source"
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## So what is "free software"?
- It could be anything from the FSF / GNU
- Or anything under a "free" license
- Typically it is called "FOSS" for "free and open source software"
  - This can include many licenses, including the GPL
  - This term is different than "free open source software" from the previous slide
- Licenses are approved as "open source licenses" by the [Open Source Initiative (OSI)](http://opensource.org/) based on their [Open Source Definition (OSD)](http://opensource.org/osd)

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## [GNU General Public License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)
- Called the ‘copyleft’
- All derivative works ***<font color="red">MUST</font>*** be released under the SAME license – even if it is only a small part that uses the GPL
  - This causes it to be very restrictive
  - Thus, it is is called a "viral" license
- GNU software: Linux kernel, gcc/g++, etc.

## Let's use GPL code but not tell!

- A Linksys (then Cisco) network storage device (product [NAS200](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAS200)) ran a customized version of Linux
  - As did other products that Linksys developed
  - And Linux is released under the GPL
- Linksys did not release the code, even when requested, and they were taken to court
  - They were ordered to release their source code because of the GPL viral clause, although the settled
- The case is [*Free Software Foundation v. Cisco Systems*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation_v._Cisco_Systems) (2008)
- This was the first (real) court-backed enforcement of the GPL, and set a legal precedent
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)
- One of the simplest non-restrictive open source licenses
- Three parts:
  - Anybody can use the software for free for any use
  - The license must be included in the software
  - There is no warranty
- Ruby on Rails and CakePHP are released under this license
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">

	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## [BSD License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses)
- A set of permissive licenses
- Two variants are GPL-compatible
  - Meaning they can be combined with GPL code, although the resulting code must be released under the GPL
  - Thus, they are considered both "free software licenses" by the FSF as well as "open source licenses" by the [OSI](http://opensource.org/)
- The 4-clause variant is not (or widely accepted), due to the advertising clause (item 3 shown [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#4-clause_license_.28original_.22BSD_License.22.29))
    - This clause (and variant) has since fallen out of favor
- Django is released under the BSD license
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## [Lesser GPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License)
- Designed as a compromise between the restrictive GPL and the permissive MIT/BSD licenses
- Differences between LGPL and GPL
  - LGPL does not place restrictions on software that *links* with LPGL code
    - Thus, it is primarily used for software libraries
  - Need not display license from the command line
- Originally called "Library GPL"
- Software using this license: OpenOffice.org, LibreOffice
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Other licenses
- [Mozilla Public License (MPL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Public_License) is a hybrid of the BSD and GPL licenses (software: Firefox, Thunderbird)
- [Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Development_and_Distribution_License) is similar to, and based off of, the MPL (software: bash, NetBeans)
- [Apache License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License) requires any *change* in the software to be released in source form (software: Apache, Android)
- [Microsoft Public License (MS-PL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_source#Microsoft_Public_License_.28Ms-PL.29): unrestrictive, and similar to MIT and BSD
- [Microsoft Reciprocal License (MS-RL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_source#Microsoft_Reciprocal_License_.28Ms-RL.29): like MS-PL, but you must release changes in source form

## [Creative Commons License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license)
- A means by which authors of works can specify the terms under which people can share said works
  - Typically (but not always) used for non-software works
- There are four condition modules:
  - Attribution (BY): requires attribution to original author
  - Share alike (SA): derivative works allowed, but under the same license
  - Non-commercial (NC): prevents commercial use
  - No derivative works (ND): prevents derivative works
- A license is specified by the terms:
  - "CC BY-SA", which is what Wikipedia and the github SLP and PDR repositories are released under
  - "CC BY-NC", which is what xkcd is released under

# Licenses and You
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What this means for this course
- Ruby on Rails and CakePHP are both released under the MIT license
- Django is released under the BSD license
- But if we include any GPL code, we have to release the *entire* system under the GPL
  - We can link to LGPL libraries just fine...
- Because we are developing real software for real customers, we have to pay attention to this
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## But if you want to use GPL code...
- Here is one alternative:
  - Consider a single sub-system that is based of GPL code
  - You can rewrite that sub-system, and release just that sub-system under the GPL (or LGPL)
  - Then use the *binary*  from that sub-system in your non-GPL system
- This allows you to use a GPL component, but not release your entire system under the GPL
  - Your installation instructions will have to separate detail how to download and install the sub-system
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## If you ever set software free...
- ... it will come back to you if it loves you...
- If you release it under the GPL, you can never "un-do" that decision!

# UVa & Student<br>Software

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Who owns your code?
- If you were paid by the university...
  - ... as a graduate student, paid RA, etc...
  - ... then the university would own your code
- But since you are not paid by the university, you own your code
  - And you can release it, GPL it, sell it, do nothing with it, etc.
  - Since it is a group project, the system is considered to be jointly-owned, and it’s up to the group to hash out any details...
- This is a university policy, and it follows federal copyright law
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## SLP student agreement
- As mentioned earlier, there is an agreement ([pdf](../uva/student-participation-form.pdf), [word](../uva/student-participation-form.docx)) developed in conjunction with UVa's provost’s office and general counsel that does the following:
  - The non-profit obtains the right to use your system forever (including the source code), but they can never release it, sell it, or claim that it was written by them
    - They could hire a developer to enhance it, for example, but the enhanced version would have the same restrictions (can not be released or sold)
    - They can install it on any of their machines that they need to
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## SLP student agreement
- Your rights are not restricted in any way
  - You are just giving some (limited) rights to the nonprofit
- It also releases UVa from any responsibility if your software fails
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Must you sign it?
- Can I force you to sign it?
  - No!  Nobody can force you to give up your rights
  - Even though what you are giving up is really just the ability to charge the nonprofit for your project in the future
- But if you do not, then you can not work on a project with an external entity (i.e., a nonprofit)
  - This means you will have to take the independent project capstone track
  - This agreement has gotten approval from the provost's office at UVa
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="nda"><script type="text/template">
## Non-disclosure agreement
- There is a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) that has also been created for you by UVa ([pdf](../uva/capstone-nda-for-students.pdf), [word](../uva/capstone-nda-for-students.docx))
- The nonprofits will have information that they do not want to have released, and thus will likely ask you to sign the NDA
- This form was created to prevent nonprofits from having you sign a less favorable NDA
- This form ONLY deals with the nonprofit's information and data; you still own the code
  - There is no IP transfer, releasing of other rights, etc., in this form
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Must you sign it?
- Like the capstone agreement, I cannot force you to sign it
- But you can't work on a project for a nonprofit without signing it
  - And thus you will likely have take the independent capstone track
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Warning
- All the nonprofits were told that, if they wanted an NDA signed, then they had to either:
  1. Use the one we provide ([pdf](../uva/capstone-nda-for-students.pdf), [word](../uva/capstone-nda-for-students.docx))
  2. Get theirs approved by UVa *prior* to having you sign it
- Under **NO CIRCUMSTANCES** are you to sign any form provided by the nonprofit that is not this NDA until you ***FIRST*** speak to me (and/or the legal powers at UVa)
  - I don't expect this to ever happen, by the way...
- The capstone agreement is given to you by me, not by the nonprofit
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## UVa Legal Agreements
- There is a [UVa Legal Forms](../uva/legal.html) page in the repo with 3 forms:
  - "Student Participation and Release Form" ([pdf](../uva/student-participation-form.pdf), [word](../uva/student-participation-form.docx)), which is the SLP Student Agreement just mentioned
    - I will have you sign this form when projects are assigned
  - "Capstone NDA" ([pdf](../uva/capstone-nda-for-students.pdf), [word](../uva/capstone-nda-for-students.docx)), which is the non-disclosure agreement form
    - The nonprofits will (likely) have you sign this form
  - "Customer Information Agreement" ([pdf](../uva/customer-project-agreement.pdf), [word](../uva/customer-project-agreement.docx)), which is a form that only the nonprofits sign
    - It indicates that they are aware of a bunch of disclaimers and their licensing agreements
- Please read these forms through!!!
