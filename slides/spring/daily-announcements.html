## Deliverable for Iteration 11
- The unit tests from the last iteration
  - There was confusion (amid trips, snow days, and spring break) in getting them done fully correctly in the last iteration
  - You should have them already done, but not necessarily in the right "form"
  - Details on the next slide
- An updated requirements document (this should have been kept up-to-date)
- The full transition plan: this contains:
  - An updated deployment plan (iteration 7)
  - An updated master test plan (iteration 8)
  - A working Jenkins build for your unit tests (iteration 9)
  - A half dozen (or so) unit tests (iteration 10)
  - The updated requirements document (iteration 11)
- Some of these may require editing from the original
- This should be "packaged" into a single document
  - A single Redmine wiki page, with links to the various parts (which are presumably sub-pages), is fine

## Unit Tests
- For iteration 10 (and will be checked for iteration 11) you should have a half-dozen or so unit tests written
  - These should be *real* unit tests that test *real* code
  - Have a variety: test a model, a controller, a view, etc.
- They should be scripted to run with the Jenkins build
- You should indicate to me how this is done so that I can find them
  - In the lead's TPS report is fine
  - But you need to tell me *where* to find the unit tests!

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## You should be aware of this!
Your ability to pass this course is contingent on the fact that, as of Tuesday, March 25th (tomorrow!) at noon, you have a *fully working system* deployed to the *final deployemnt host*.

&nbsp;  

- "Fully working system" means that you have implemented all the features in the requirements document, and they (more or less) work
  - There can be bugs, of course, at this point
  - Hence the need for an updated requirements document
  - And you need to speak to me if there are any *major* changes to that document
- "Final deployment host" is what is specified in your deployment plan; it is *not* pegasus!

&nbsp;  
As mentioned on day 1 of this semester, if these are not done, then you will <span class="red">fail this class</span> and then likely not graduate.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Transition Phase
- It's 3 iterations (6 weeks) long
- During the transition phase, Jenkins must *always* build successfully
  - If your commit breaks something, then you should immediately fix it
  - This means that you need to run the test after you do a commit (which is the point of this type of testing, anyway)
  - I will be regularly checking that the builds work...
- There will be iteration deliverables (the various artifacts in the [deliverables slide set](02-deliverables.html)
  - I will detail these as we go through the transition phase
  - The only one I leave to you to schedule is the final STS technical report
    - I need that two weeks before it is due to your STS professor (so take the *earliest* deadline of the group)
    - 1 week for me to read it, and 1 week for you to make edits to the document after I comment on it
- 6-person groups will have one lead for the entire transition period
  - The 7 person group will change leads one iteration into the transition phase

## Lecture ??: March 16th, 2014
- Evaluations: I'm all caught up!
  - Please check them!  If your lead did not submit a TPS report, then I was unable to judge progress, and *everybody* in the group received a poor evaluation
  - For secretaries, having an entry of "no notes present in Redmine" is *bad*
- We are half-way into iteration 11
  - Leads, your first weekly report is due tomorrow at noon
- Remember that next Monday, March 24th, is the deadline to complete development!
- Don't forget to report your hours!  This is factoring into your course grade (that you submit them, not how many hours you report)
- As mentioned on the first day, at some point we would run out of relevant topics to cover in lecture
  - We've reached that point
  - So now both Mondays and Wednesdays will be group meeting days
- There is a CS dept "town hall" this Thursday @ 5 in Olsson 120 from 5-6
  - Free pizza!
  - This will be your best chance to have your opinions heard by the department chair!

## Deliverable for Iteration 11
- The unit tests from the last iteration
  - There was confusion (amid trips, snow days, and spring break) in getting them done fully correctly in the last iteration
  - You should have them already done, but not necessarily in the right "form"
  - Details on the next slide
- An updated requirements document (this should have been kept up-to-date)
- The full transition plan: this contains:
