# Introduction

## Ah, Meetings...

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Ah, Meetings...
- Studies of software developers have shown that nearly 60% of your time as a developer is working with another person
  - 28% working with just one other person
  - 30% working with two or more people
  - (these numbers came from somewhere valid, but I have no idea where...)
- Programming is NOT a solo activity!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meetings of All Flavors
- Meetings come in all different forms
- They change based on where you currently are in the project
- Early in the project (inception phase):
  - Pitch meeting
  - Vision meeting
  - Contract negotiation
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meetings of All Flavors
- Starting the project:
  - Requirements elicitation and modeling
  - Initial customer meetings
- End of the project:
  - Post-mortem
  - Customer wrap-up
 - Maintenance planning
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Stuck in the middle with you
- During the course of the project are the regular meetings that drive how a project progresses
- These are called different things in each process
  - Daily meeting
  - Stand-Up meeting
  - Scrum meeting
  - Iteration meeting
- In the end, these all drive the iterative process
	  </script></section>

## Scrum Iterations

	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How do we differ?
- This is not your full time job
- You do not have an office to go to
- You do not have a clock to punch (i.e. you do your work at odd hours)
- You are not being paid (sort of...)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How does this affect your meetings?
- Frequency
- Timing (ideally, held at same time/place)
- Accountability
- Routine (set questions to answer usually)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What makes a bad meeting?
- We've all been in them... what do you think?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What this should not affect
- Meetings with the customer need to "follow the rules"
- Even though our process is a little different, customers are still customers!
- If anything, we need to show that we're on top of what we're working on!

# Driving a Customer Meeting
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Driving a Customer Meeting
- Customers are fickle creatures
  - Some will want to drive the meeting
  - Some will want you to drive
  - Some will wait for any requests for comments
  - Some will offer comments so readily you won't get a word in
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Driving a Customer Meeting
- Rule #1: Do not wing it!
  - These people are "paying" you
  - You should have a well thought out demonstration / presentation ready to go
  - You should have specific questions planned out
  - You should have these items prioritized so you get through the high-value items first
  - The customer will not come to the meeting with things to talk about -- they are going to follow ***your*** lead
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Driving a Customer Meeting
- Rule #2: Ask their opinion!
  - Some customers will give you their thoughts no matter what
  - Others, you need to draw it out
  - The trick is to get them to comment specifically on things and not to give general answers
  - Try to draw them into talking about a specific feature or question
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Driving a Customer Meeting
- Rule #3: Incomplete work can't be demonstrated
  - Focus on your successes from the past iteration
  - But don't hide the fact that you didn't complete something
  - But also don't put it in their face that you didn't complete something!
  - Keep the meeting on a positive note
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Driving a Customer Meeting
- Rule #4: Set priorities for the next iteration
  - Based on what you show off this week, derive what are the next most important features that should be worked on during the coming iteration
  - Remember: the customer chooses with your input, not the other way around!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Driving a Customer Meeting
- Rule #5: Be professional
  - Act professional -- watch your jokes, appropriate language, etc.
  - Dress properly -- we aren't talking a suit here, but maybe comb your hair and put on a clean shirt
    - (and pants)
    - (okay, we can go a bit beyond this)
  - Don't ask inappropriate questions
  - Use the appropriate terminology, including politically correct terminology
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Driving a Customer Meeting
- Rule #6: Understand the mentor's role
  - The mentor is the grad student, in our case
    - And will not be present at the customer meetings
  - S/he is there to offer advice
    - This may be occasional guidance, or it may be a full walk-through of something
  - S/he is there to make sure that the project is progressing
  - S/he is NOT there to code
    - In fact, for legal reasons, s/he can NEVER contribute code
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meeting Planning
- Develop an agenda
- Plan out your demo
- Come up with questions
- Come up with ideas on what will be in the next iteration
- Decide what is a reasonable workload in the next iteration
	  </script></section>

# Legal Issues
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Legal rules
- The following rules are in addition to the NDAs and overall legal agreement (found [here](../uva/legal.html)), which have been discussed previously
- The three rules that follow have been created in conjunction with Rick Schupp, the directory of [UVa's office of Risk Management](http://www.virginia.edu/riskmanagement/)
  - They are not a judgment of your capabilities as an adult
  - Nor is it a judgment of the customer
  - It is simply a set of guidelines to keep you safe
    - And to address a UVa liability issue
- Because you are being 'assigned' to a customer, UVa (and me!) wants to make sure that you are not forced into a uncomfortable situation as a result of this assignment
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Legal rule # 1
- You are NEVER to be in a meeting with a customer just by yourself -- you must be in a group of at least 2 student group members
  - Preferably more, if possible
  - Likewise, if you go to the customer's site, you MUST have another group member along with you
  - No exceptions!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Legal rule # 2
- You are NEVER to be in a situation where the customer gives you a ride home (or anywhere else)
  - If you do not have transportation, then either make them come to you, or don't have the meeting that week
  - If you are stranded, hire a cab and I will personally pay you back
    - But only do this if you are really stranded; I'm not paying all the groups' transportations costs here...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Legal rule # 3
- If anything in a meeting feels wrong, or makes you feel uncomfortable, you should leave immediately and let me know ASAP
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Notification
- The customers will all be made aware of these rules
- If it ever comes up, please let them know that I have insisted on this
  - You ***SHOULD*** defer the blame to me -- that's my job
- Feel free to chat with me about any of these issues (or any of your customer interactions)
